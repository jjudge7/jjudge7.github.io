##UI Programming Start on iOS -- WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT DONE

I try to make basic UI programming as painless as possible.  I prefer to spend time on more interesting programming tasks.  It is much more fun to manipulate camera output or articulate the design for threading or other systems concepts.

I was concerned with the memory management in Objective C.  I decided to use Automatic Reference Counting, otherwise known as ARC.  [This article is part 1 of a tutorial on ARC.](http://www.raywenderlich.com/5677/beginning-arc-in-ios-5-part-1)  [This Dr Dobbs article explains ARC with a sample.](
http://www.drdobbs.com/mobile/automatic-reference-counting-on-ios/240000820) Defining properties [as shown on this cheat sheet](http://cdn1.raywenderlich.com/downloads/RW-Objective-C-Cheatsheet-v-1-5.pdf) need to be understood.  Also, ARC ignores memory allocation by stdlib and Core Foundation APIs - as expected.  That memory has to be handled manually.

A UI Screen in iOS can be created entirely in code or via .xib or .storyboard xml files.  [This is a video of a debate on that issue.](http://www.raywenderlich.com/51992/storyboards-vs-nibs-vs-code-the-great-debate) Frankly, I find that there is room for all three methods, and I am preferring to make a few small storyboard files.  Note that Apple prefers that we use storyboards.  [In this video about the Facebook build process, the speaker mentioned that they wrote the UI for their app entirely in code.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5RqcYzrY4Y&feature=youtu.be&t=15m20s)

A storyboard contains xibs connected by segues that make it easy to handle transitions between the xibs. [This Apple tutorial shows how to start.  Look for the words "Identity inspector" to see how to link the created controller class with the storyboard.](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/SecondTutorial.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011343-CH8-SW1)  To make connections from UI elements to the class, use the control key as shown [in the video on this page](http://oleb.net/blog/2011/06/creating-outlets-and-actions-via-drag-and-drop-in-xcode-4/).  The outlets represent the objects, and the actions are events for those objects.

If that seems daunting, note that the book, [iOS 7 App Development by Neil Smyth](http://www.amazon.com/iOS-7-App-Development-Essentials-ebook/dp/B00FPT5BKK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1391741951&sr=1-1), is awesome for getting started on UIs.  That book shows a lot of things in detail if you are not used to the interface.

I am skipping many steps that I will write later.

This is a way to bring up the controller for a storyboard named Profile_iPhone.xib from an action event in a GUI.

	ProfileViewController * profileViewController = [[UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"Profile_iPhone" bundle:nil] instantiateInitialViewController];
	[self presentViewController:profileViewController animated:YES completion:nil];

This is a way to bring up the controller for a xib named Login_iPhone.xib from the AppDelete didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method:

	self.loginViewController = [[LoginViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"Login_iPhone" bundle:nil];
	self.window.rootViewController = self.loginViewController;
	[self.window makeKeyAndVisible];

I have a lot more to write and explain - and understand.  I assume no one sees this yet.
